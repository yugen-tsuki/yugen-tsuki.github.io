							<h2>Intel SGX: The CPU Based Defense System</h2>
						</header>
						<p>According to Intel, its Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), allows user-level code to allocate private
                            regions of memory, called enclaves, which are designed to be protected from processes running at higher
                            privilege levels. What stands out to me is that SGX is a CPU-based defense system and since it allows
                            applications to run in private memory space, overall system vulnerability is reduced. CPU instructions are
                            used to increase access control which prevents data modification, deletion and disclosure and thereby
                            enhances code security. When an application is run inside an enclave, the CPU instantly encrypts it and
                            stores the key and since the key is inside the CPU, it cannot be obtained by inspecting system memory.
                            Spectre is an Intel processor vulnerability but even that did not seem to affect the SGX enclaves as the
                            enclave security was designed in a way that prevented even operating systems from accessing the data in
                            these enclaves.</p>
                            <p>
                            Till now, Intel SGX seemed impenetrable but this is where SGXPECTRE comes in. This attack exploits
                            the race condition between the injected, speculatively executed memory references which then leads to
                            side-channel observable cache traces and latency of branch resolution.</p>
                            <p>
                            ÆPIC Leak is an architectural flaw which also enables attacks against SGX enclaves and forces specific
                            data into caches leading to leaked targeted secrets. The Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
                            (APIC) mechanism manages and routes interrupts but there exists a bug, an uninitialized memory read,
                            which happens when memory space is not cleared after the CPU is done processing it, causing the leak of
                            old data that is no longer needed.</p>
                            <p>I found this interesting <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Software-Guard-Extensions/Meltdown-Spectre-impact-on-SGX/td-p/1180482">thread</a> where Dan O'Keeffe from the LSDS group at Imperial College London
                            shared a <a href="https://github.com/lsds/spectre-attack-sgx">proof-of-concept</a> Spectre-like attack on Intel SGX enclaves in the Intel community forum and an
                            expert from Intel reviewed it and made several detailed observations. Another interesting <a href="https://beincrypto.com/privacy-focused-secret-network-vulnerability-discovered-security-researchers/">article</a> I came
                            across was about the Secret Network which is a protocol that focuses heavily on private transactions. A
                            group of security researchers were examining the network for ÆPIC Leak vulnerabilities and ended up
                            finding the master decryption key for the entire network.The vulnerability was related to Intel’s Software
                            Guard Extensions.</p><p>
                            On a concluding note, it may seem that the Intel SGX is not as impenetrable as we originally thought but
                            there are still some incredible applications of this technology. Intel, R3 and Hope for Justice are
                            collaborating to build an application that enables organizations combating modern slavery to confidently
                            share sensitive data related to individual cases. This Data Exchange application takes advantage of the
                            Intel® Software Guard Extensions because it enables multiple organizations to collaborate on shared
                            analysis and validate algorithms while shielding confidential or regulated data from other parties. More
                            details about this collaboration can be found in this <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-solutions-help-combat-modern-140000013.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHF-nu9x7Ek1R4LVsl9tSMIPb7XBnrHMpydFVjxA0ArjTtoU4sWi53T7GaUcW4OVVqNdF9RA-FkXiXfG7KdHZFEDvBTVkKhu-DCwGQ5DJMzQM_uJ9uRpekeXezd96mf0moK3T4YQcSIIPX_ws6B0uDdM7rYTCGiemt9bEGcA_atc&guccounter=2">article</a>.</p>

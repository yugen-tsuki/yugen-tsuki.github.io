                        <p>The project aimed to simulate and understand essential networking concepts by configuring a Cisco Router and a Linux PC as a LAN switch within a virtual environment. The simulation utilized GNS3 for network emulation and Wireshark for packet analysis. Key objectives included configuring the network elements, observing MAC table updates, and implementing a spanning tree protocol for loop-free routing.

                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Network Configuration: The project involved configuring a Cisco Router and a Linux PC within GNS3 to simulate a LAN switch environment. This allowed for hands-on experience in setting up network components.</li>
                            <li>MAC Table Updates: During the simulation, the project explored how LAN switches update their MAC tables in response to network activity, showcasing the dynamic nature of Ethernet-based networks.</li>
                            <li>Spanning Tree Protocol: An integral part of the project was the implementation and observation of a spanning tree protocol. This protocol ensures loop-free routing within the network, enhancing network reliability.</li>
                            <li>Packet Analysis: Wireshark was employed to capture and analyze network packets, providing insights into network behavior, frame forwarding, and protocol operations.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
                        <p>Computer Networks was a mandatory course during my undergrad and while I found it to be very daunting, I was also deeply interested in it. Thus, I elected to pursue the course a second time during my masters and fell in love with the simplicity and efficiency of networking algorithms. This project was an effort on my part to further solidify my understanding of the subject by practical implementation of core concepts. By successfully configuring and simulating a LAN switch environment and observing how LAN switches manage MAC tables and implement spanning tree protocols, this project enhanced my understanding of critical networking concepts and hands-on network management skills.</p>
